# Vasanth Kumar -- @vasanthkumar18

I'm Vasanth Kumar, currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science at NIT Calicut. I'm seeking to have a growth oriented and challenging career, where I can contribute my knowledge and skills to the organisation and enhance my experience through continuous learning and teamwork.

Previously, I've worked at KYC HUB as an SDE Intern where I was a part of FinCAI team. I assisted in various activities to deliver end-to-end projects leading to KYC and AML capabilities. My tasks were based on Extraction, cleaning of datasource and analyzing them using technologies of Java, Selenium, ElasticSearch and Postman API in an Agile methodology. 

Off the work, I enjoy creating digital illustrations and various posters using Adobe softwares such as Illustrator or Photoshop.
